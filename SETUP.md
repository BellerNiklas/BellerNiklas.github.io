# Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Profile Photo

Your profile photo has been provided and needs to be saved as `profile.jpg` in the root directory.

To add it:
1. Save your profile photo from the conversation/upload
2. Resize it to approximately 400x400 pixels (optional but recommended)
3. Name it `profile.jpg`
4. Place it in the root directory: `C:\Users\nikla\Projects\BellerNiklas.github.io\profile.jpg`

Alternatively, you can use any image editor or online tool to prepare the image, or I can help you do this programmatically.
